Robotics Runtime Adaptation Toolchain
======================

Robotics Runtime Adapation is a collection of Eclipse plugins that support the development of component based systems that can adapt their architecture at run-time according to the state of the context. 

The content of this repository is a work in progress, and the model and tools are in a beta version.

In order to be used they need some of the plugins provided by the [HyperFlex toolchain](https://github.com/Robotics-UniBG/HyperFlex)

Please see the wiki for more information.
